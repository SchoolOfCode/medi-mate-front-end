# Medi-Mate - FRONT-END

There are many people who would like to meditate, but struggle to build that habit.

## Tech Stack
![react-native]()We chose react-native since the app would be predominatly be used on peoples phones. This gave us the oportunity to code for Android, ios and web all at the same time. However, the trade offs were that ract-native is essentialy still at beta stage and could cause problems for us with intergration of other software.

Why we cose firebase authorisation over auth0

react-native, JS, StyleSheet, expo CLI, add more HERE
