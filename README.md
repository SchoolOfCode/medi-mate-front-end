## Deployment
**Steps to deploy on netlify**
1. "npx create-react-native-app ."
2. "expo build:web"
3. remove build-web from .gitignore
4. Go to "Site Settings" and find "Build & Deploy"
5. Update build command and publish directory (publish directory contains usable index.html file). build command should be "expo build:web" and publish directory should be "web-build"
6. Deploy again- It worked :P

**Update deploy setup**
1. create script called 'build' in package.json
2. in build script add value "expo build:web && git push"

**Update deploy**
1. git add . && git commit -m "commit message"
2. npm run build
